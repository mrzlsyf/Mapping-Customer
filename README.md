# 📌 Mapping Customer 🧑🏻‍💼
🚀 This project leverages **PySpark's scalable computing power** to perform customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This system performs two key tasks:
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Uses the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers based on various features.
2. **Distributed Computation with PySpark**: Leverages PySpark's distributed framework for handling large-scale customer data efficiently.

This project is valuable for **business analysts, marketers, and data scientists** to understand customer behaviour better and improve targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** 📊
   - Loads customer data from a CSV file.
   - Preprocesses the dataset for clustering.
2. **K-Means Clustering Implementation** 🤖
   - Uses PySpark’s MLlib to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
   - Assign cluster labels to customers.
